Testing out the Odin Project with already learned skills in HTML to compare it to other platforms used to learn coding. i.e. freeCodeCamp, CS50x

Found to be more comprehensive than both other platforms. fCC has it's own in browser text editor and viewer for HTML and CS50x teaches more historical and fundamental knowledge but less involved in the coding process and setting up for real workspace environment.
